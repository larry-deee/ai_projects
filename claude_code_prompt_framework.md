**Timeline**: [Proof of concept/Production ready/Iterative development]
**Team Knowledge**: [Technologies team is familiar with]
**Maintenance Requirements**: [How simple does ongoing maintenance need to be]

## ü§ñ Agent Framework Analysis

Using the claude-code-sub-agents framework from https://github.com/lst97/claude-code-sub-agents

### Orchestration Requirements
**Primary Pattern Needed**: [Sequential/Parallel/Conditional routing]
**Quality Gates**: [Where validation/review steps are critical]
**Coordination Complexity**: [Simple handoffs vs complex multi-agent workflows]

### Specialized Expertise Needed
**Architecture**: [backend-architect, cloud-architect, etc.]
**Implementation**: [python-pro, golang-pro, frontend-developer, etc.]
**Quality Assurance**: [security-auditor, code-reviewer, test-automator]
**Operations**: [deployment-engineer, performance-engineer, etc.]

## üìê Architecture Decision Framework

Please analyze and provide:

### 1. Requirements Clarification
- Identify any ambiguous or missing requirements
- Propose optimal technical approaches
- Flag potential architecture decisions that need validation

### 2. Agent Orchestration Strategy
```
[Agent 1] ‚Üí [Agent 2] ‚Üí [Agent 3] ‚Üí ...
     ‚Üì           ‚Üì           ‚Üì
[Validator] [Reviewer] [Quality Gate]
```

**Sequential Tasks**: [Tasks that must be completed in order]
**Parallel Tasks**: [Tasks that can be done simultaneously]
**Review Gates**: [Critical validation points]
**Token Optimization**: [How to minimize back-and-forth]

### 3. Implementation Architecture
- **Core Components**: [Main application components needed]
- **Integration Points**: [External system interfaces]
- **Data Flow**: [How information moves through the system]
- **Error Handling**: [Critical failure modes to address]

## üìù Task Specification Generation

Create a comprehensive task specification following this structure:

### Task 1: Context & Architecture
**Agent**: context-manager ‚Üí [primary architect agent]
**Objective**: [Establish context and design overall architecture]
**Deliverables**: [Specific outputs needed]
**Constraints**: [Technical and resource limitations]

### Task 2: Core Implementation
**Agent**: [primary implementation agent]
**Objective**: [Build core functionality]
**Deliverables**: [Specific files, features, capabilities]
**Integration Requirements**: [APIs, tools, frameworks to integrate]

### Task 3: [Quality/Security/Validation]
**Agent**: [relevant specialist agent]
**Objective**: [Ensure quality standards met]
**Deliverables**: [Reviews, fixes, validations]

### Task 4: Testing & Validation
**Agent**: test-automator
**Objective**: [Verify functionality and requirements]
**Deliverables**: [Test suites, validation reports]

### Task 5: Documentation & Review
**Agent**: api-documenter ‚Üí code-reviewer
**Objective**: [Complete project with documentation]
**Deliverables**: [Documentation, final quality review]

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements Met**: [How to verify core functionality works]
**Quality Standards**: [Code quality, security, performance benchmarks]
**Integration Validation**: [How to test external integrations]
**Deployment Readiness**: [What constitutes "ready to deploy"]
**Maintenance Considerations**: [Long-term viability factors]

## ‚ö° Token Efficiency Considerations

**Minimize Iterations**: [Design for single-pass success]
**Clear Specifications**: [Detailed enough to avoid clarification requests]
**Agent Expertise Alignment**: [Match tasks to agent capabilities]
**Context Preservation**: [How to maintain context across agent handoffs]

## Output Format Requested

Please provide:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Clarify any ambiguous requirements and propose solutions
2. **Architecture Recommendation**: Optimal technical approach for the requirements
3. **Agent Orchestration Plan**: Specific agent sequence with clear handoffs
4. **Detailed Task Specifications**: Ready-to-execute tasks for each agent
5. **Success Validation Framework**: How to verify completion at each stage

Focus on creating a token-efficient, single-execution plan that maximizes the specialized expertise of each agent while minimizing the need for iterative refinement.

## **üîß Framework Customization Guide**

### **For Different Application Types**

**API/Microservice Projects**:
- Emphasize `backend-architect` ‚Üí `python-pro/golang-pro` ‚Üí `security-auditor`
- Include API documentation requirements
- Focus on integration testing

**Frontend Applications**:
- Lead with `frontend-developer` ‚Üí `react-pro/nextjs-pro` ‚Üí `performance-engineer`
- Include responsive design requirements
- Emphasize user experience validation

**Full-Stack Applications**:
- Use `full-stack-developer` coordination with specialists
- Include both frontend and backend quality gates
