"""
Gunicorn Configuration for Async Optimized Salesforce Models API Gateway
========================================================================

Production-ready configuration for running the async optimized server with:
- Thread-safe connection pooling
- Optimal worker configuration
- Performance monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling

Usage:
