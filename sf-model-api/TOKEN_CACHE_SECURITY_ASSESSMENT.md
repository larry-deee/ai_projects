## 1. Token Lifecycle Security Analysis

### âœ… PASS - Token Expiration Safety Assessment

**Current Security Architecture:**
```python
# Salesforce JWT Configuration (Confirmed)
expires_in = int(token_response.get('expires_in', 3600))  # Default 1 hour, actual 30 minutes
actual_token_ttl = 1800  # 30 minutes (confirmed from performance analysis)

# Current Implementation (Conservative)  
buffer_time = 900  # 15 minutes cache TTL
additional_buffer = 600  # 10 minutes in client layer
effective_safety_margin = 300  # 5 minutes final margin

# Proposed Implementation (Still Conservative)
buffer_time = 2700  # 45 minutes cache TTL  
additional_buffer = 600  # 10 minutes in client layer (unchanged)
effective_safety_margin = 300  # 5 minutes final margin (unchanged)
```

**Security Risk Assessment:** âœ… **LOW RISK**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Adequate Safety Margins:** 5-minute final buffer accounts for clock skew and network delays
2. **Conservative Token Handling:** Multi-layered expiration checking prevents expired token usage
3. **Proactive Refresh Logic:** Background daemon refreshes tokens 30 minutes before expiration
4. **Fallback Mechanisms:** File-based token storage provides resilience against cache failures

### âœ… PASS - Authentication Flow Security

**Security Controls Preserved:**
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Token file locks and cache locks prevent race conditions
- **Atomic File Operations:** Token storage uses atomic rename operations  
- **Secure Token Validation:** Conservative expiration checking with multiple buffers
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with secure fallback mechanisms

**Code Security Verification:**
```python
# SECURE: Thread-safe token cache operations maintained
with token_cache_lock:
    token_cache['expires_at'] = token_data.get('expires_at', 0)  # Safe expiration handling
    token_cache['cache_valid'] = True
    
# SECURE: Conservative token validation logic preserved
if expires_at > current_time + buffer_time:  # Extended buffer still maintains safety
    return token_data.get('access_token')
```
