**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com
ANTHROPIC_VERSION=2023-06-01
ANTHROPIC_TIMEOUT=60.0
ANTHROPIC_MAX_CONNECTIONS=200
ANTHROPIC_MAX_KEEPALIVE=100
```

### 2. Enhanced AnthropicNativeRouter (`src/routers/anthropic_native.py`)

**Improvements Made:**
- **Async/Sync Compatibility**: Fixed Flask async compatibility issues with proper event loop management
- **Enhanced SSE Streaming**: Improved streaming implementation with proper headers and byte-based transmission
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper Anthropic error format responses
- **Type Hints**: Complete type annotations for all methods
- **CORS Support**: Added comprehensive CORS headers for web application integration

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /anthropic/v1/messages/count_tokens` - Token counting endpoint
- `GET /anthropic/v1/models` - Models listing endpoint
- Enhanced `GET /anthropic/health` - Health check with endpoint documentation

**Features:**
- Thread-safe async execution within Flask context
- Proper SSE streaming with nginx buffering disabled
- Enhanced error responses in native Anthropic format
- Comprehensive request validation

### 3. Application Lifecycle Integration

**Enhancements:**
- Added graceful shutdown integration to both Flask (`llm_endpoint_server.py`) and Quart (`async_endpoint_server.py`) servers
- Automatic resource cleanup on application termination
- Proper httpx client lifecycle management
- Memory leak prevention with proper async context cleanup

### 4. Environment Configuration Enhancement

**Improvements:**
- Updated `.env.example` with all new Anthropic configuration options
- Comprehensive configuration validation with error messages
- Automatic adjustment of invalid configurations (e.g., keepalive > connections)
- Support for environment-based feature toggles

### 5. Production-Ready Code Quality

**Enhancements:**
- **Type Hints**: Complete type annotations throughout codebase
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all public methods
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- **Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate levels and context
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Code formatted according to Python standards
- **Resource Management**: Proper async resource cleanup and lifecycle management

## ðŸš€ Key Features Implemented

### Native Pass-Through Architecture
- Zero schema transformation preserving native Anthropic request/response format

## ðŸ”§ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from adapters.anthropic_native import AnthropicNativeAdapter

# Initialize with environment configuration
adapter = AnthropicNativeAdapter()
await adapter.initialize()

# Native message call
response = await adapter.messages({
    "model": "claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
})

# Streaming
async for chunk in await adapter.messages(request_data, stream=True):
    process_chunk(chunk)

# Cleanup
await adapter.shutdown()
```

### Flask Integration
```python
from routers.anthropic_native import create_anthropic_router

# Register router
app.register_blueprint(create_anthropic_router())

# Endpoints available at:
# POST /anthropic/v1/messages
# POST /anthropic/v1/messages/count_tokens  
# GET /anthropic/v1/models
# GET /anthropic/health
```

## ðŸš¦ Next Steps

The implementation is now production-ready with:
- Enterprise-grade error handling and resource management
- Complete API endpoint coverage matching Anthropic's native API
- Comprehensive configuration validation and environment support
- Full async/sync compatibility with Flask and Quart
- Production-ready code quality with type hints and documentation

The enhanced implementation provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for native Anthropic API integration while preserving the zero-transformation pass-through architecture principles.
