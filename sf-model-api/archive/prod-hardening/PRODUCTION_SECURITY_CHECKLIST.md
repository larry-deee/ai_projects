for i in {1..110}; do curl -H "X-API-Key: test" https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/chat/completions; done
# Expected: 429 after limit exceeded

curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-API-Key: valid-key" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"<script>alert(1)</script>"}]}'

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Current Status: ‚ùå NOT READY

**Blocking Issues:**
1. Exposed credentials in configuration files
2. No authentication mechanism implemented
3. Dangerous tool execution enabled
4. Missing input validation
5. CORS misconfiguration
6. Verbose error disclosure

**Estimated Remediation Time:** 2-3 weeks

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement immediate security fixes (24-48 hours)
2. Complete high-priority security controls (1 week)
3. Conduct security testing (1 week)
4. Obtain security sign-offs (2-3 days)

### Go-Live Criteria

**All Critical and High items must be ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

Only when this checklist shows 100% completion for Critical and High priority items should the application be considered ready for production deployment.
